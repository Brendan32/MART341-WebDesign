      <h2>The Excerpt, Pages xi to xii</h2>
      <p>I still get nightmares. In fact I get them so often I should be used
        to them by now. I'm not. No one ever really get used to nightmares.</p>
      <p>For a while there I tried every pill imaginable. Anything to curb the
        fear. Excedrin PMs, Melatonin, L-tryptophan, Valium, Vicodin, quite a
        few members of the barbital family. A pretty extensive list, frequently
        mixed, often matched, with shots of bourbon, a few lung rasping bong
        hits, sometimes even the vaporous confidence-trip of cocaine. None of it
        helped. I think it's pretty safe to assume there's no lab sophisticated
        enough yet to synthesize the kind of chemicals I need. A Nobel Prize to
        the one who invents that puppy.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I'm so tired. Sleep's been stalking me for too long to remember.
        Inevitable I suppose. Sadly though, I'm not looking forward to the
        prospect. I say "sadly" because there was a time when I actually enjoyed
        sleeping. In fact I slept all the time. That was before my friend Lude
        woke me up at three in the morning and asked me to come over to his
        place. Who knows, if I hadn't heard the phone ring, would everything be
        different now? I think about that a lot.</p>
      <p>Actually, Lude had told me about the old man a month or so before that
        fateful evening. (Is that right? <u>fate</u>? It sure as hell wasn't
        <u>-ful</u>. Or was it exactly that?) I'd been in the throes of looking
        for an apartment after a little difficulty with a landlord who woke up
        one morning convinced he was Charles de Gaulle. I was so stunned by this
        announcement that before I could think twice I'd already told him how in
        my humble estimation he did not at all resemble an airport though the
        thought of a 757 landing on him was not at all disagreeable. I was
        promptly evicted. I could have put up a fight but the place was a
        nuthouse anyway and I was glad to leave. As it turned out Chuckie de
        Gaulle burnt the place to the ground a week later. Told the police a 757
        had crashed into it.</p>
      <p>During the following weeks, while I was couching it from Santa Monica
        to Silverlake looking for an apartment, Lude told me about this old guy
        who lived in his building. He had a first floor apartment peering out
        over a wide, overgrown courtyard. Supposedly, the old man had told Lude
        he would be dying soon. I didn't think much of it, though it wasn't
        exactly the kind of thing you forget either. At the time, I just figured
        Lude had been putting me on. He likes to exaggerate. I eventually found
        a studio in Hollywood and settled back into my mind numbing routine as
        an apprentice at a tattoo shop.</p>
      <p>It was the end of '96. Nights were cold. I was getting over this woman
        named Clara English who had told me she wanted to date someone at the
        top of the food chain. So I demonstrated my unflagging devotion to her
        memory by immediately developing a heavy crush on this stripper who had
        Thumper tattooed right beneath her G-string, barely an inch from her
        shaved pussy or as she liked to call it-"The Happiest Place On Earth."
        Suffice it say, Lude & I spent the last hours of the year alone, scouting
        for new bars, new faces, driving recklessly through the canyons, doing
        our best to talk the high midnight heavens down with a whole lot of
        bullshit. We never did. Talk them down, I mean.</p>
      <p>Then the old man died.</p>
