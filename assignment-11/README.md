1. A system font is a font that is already present in a computer's system, meaning
you don't need to import them for a user to have access to them, but systems often
don't have the same fonts. A web font, on the other hand, is one that is available
online, which you can download, import, or link for your website (this can slow
down your site). Web safe fonts are fonts that are available to more than one system,
which has the advantage of using one font without having to worry about one system
or another loading wrong.
2. Sometimes a font isn't available to the user because they have a different system.
In this scenario, it's good to include a font that their system may have, so that
the browser knows to load the next preferred font. Another problem that can appear
is when you use web fonts. These can take a moment to load, so including fallback
fonts can help have an approximation of the site content while the intended styling
loads.
