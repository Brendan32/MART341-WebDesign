1. Padding creates a space between the edges of the box and the content inside
the box. Margin creates a space between the edges of the box and its surroundings.
Borders create lines along the outside of the edges of the box.
2. I had some trouble figuring out how to get the header to fix to the top of the
page without any content being obscured, but eventually I achieved it by including
a dummy header that hides behind the real one, which prevents the rest of the page
content from moving up. It now occurs to me that setting the header position to
0 probably allowed me to just set a margin on the rest of the content, but
whatever, it's working the way it is now, and no one will be able to see the
dummy header. Outside of that, there weren't any notable struggles.
