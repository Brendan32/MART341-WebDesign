      <p class="text" id="text-one">When the Sun sets on the 7th of July, 2023,
      the last human being on the surface of the Earth will die. Cleansing fires
      will wash over the planet for seven days prior, leaving only the untainted
      plants and animals. The only survivors of the human race will be underground.
      These few will forge new societies, led by the Doctrines of the Fire Kings.
      The Folk of the Sunset Age will create a new world without war or nation,
      a new civilization without division or strife, hands joined in unity.</p>

        commanded by the Fire Kings to spread their message. I work as one of
        three interpreters and scribes of the Fire Kings and their Doctrines.
        I lead a group of 34 followers, all devoted to spreading the message as
        well. We work to gather resources and construct temporary homes underground
        for during the cleansing of the Earth. We also work tirelessly to implement
        every word of the Doctrines in our daily lives, including self-reflection,
        exploration of mind and body, restraint, and service to others. You who
        wish to follow our journey to the Sunset Age are invited to gain contact
