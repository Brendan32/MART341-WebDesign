        <p>I am Eldur Kricstafur Ros. I have been commanded by the Fire Kings to
          spread their message. I work as one of three interpreters and scribes
          of the Fire Kings and their Doctrines. I lead a group of 34 followers,
          all devoted to spreading the message as well. We work to gather
          resources and construct temporary homes underground for during the
          cleansing of the Earth. We also work tirelessly to implement every word
          of the Doctrines in our daily lives, including self-reflection,
          exploration of mind and body, restraint, and service to others. You who
          wish to follow our journey to the Sunset Age are invited to gain contact
          by submitting information below.</p>
