      <!-- I hope it's all right that I added to it a bit. -->
      <p>My dad made this dish for my family occasionally, it was an amazing<br />
        meal to have, especially with some nice pita bread. Of course, I have no<br />
        idea what recipe he specifically used, but this is the one I found. I<br />
        hope to have it again when I go back home this summer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> onion, chopped</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> small bunch cilantro, leaves and tender stems separated, chopped</li>
        <li>2 small cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 15-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>Warm pita bread, for serving</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high<br />
          heat. Add the onion and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally,<br />
          until tender, about 10 minutes. Add the cilantro stems, garlic, cumin,<br />
          paprika and red pepper flakes; season with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt and a few<br />
          grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring, until the garlic is softened and the<br />
          vegetables are coated with the spices, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F</abbr>. Stir the tomatoes with their<br />
          juices into the skillet. Reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer and<br />
          cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down and the<br />
          sauce thickens slightly, about 20 minutes; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Use the back of a spoon to make 4 wells in the sauce, 1 to 2 inches<br />
          apart. Crack an egg into each well. Run the edge of a rubber spatula<br />
          through the egg whites to break them slightly, being careful not to<br />
          break the yolks (this allows the egg whites to cook faster). Transfer<br />
          the skillet to the oven and bake until the egg whites are just set, 15<br />
          to 18 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and top with the cilantro<br />
          leaves. Serve with pita bread.</li>
      </ol>
