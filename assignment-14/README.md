1. I chose Bootstrap. I didn't really have an inspiration behind the choice, I
just picked it because it was the first one in the list (though I did think that
other libraries might be better to consider in the future).
2. I used a CDN. It was faster to find and faster to plug into my code. And,
admittedly, I was having some trouble understanding what I was supposed to do
with the files Bootstrap gives you, or how to customize anything. So, I just
copied the link code they provide and went with that.
3. As I mentioned above, I had some trouble understanding how to use the Bootstrap
files. Perhaps it was obvious, and I just didn't put it together, but eventually
I just settled with copying a CDN code and using that. I also had a little trouble
centering the canvas, but that was quickly resolved. I think the p element's
background color contributed to the canvas anyway.
