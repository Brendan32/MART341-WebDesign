1. My client was a hitman looking to advertise his services on a website. He said
it had to convey his friendliness: "the kind of site that says, this man will shake
your hand with a smile and ask how your morning was, but he'll also get the job done."
So I tried to convey this as best as I could.
2. I think of mobile-first design like this: you're building a robot that is able
to do any mechanical task a human can do. For this to be successful, the best
approach might be to work on the basic movements, then work on the precise and
tiny movements, then work on the larger sweeping movements. Figure out how to make
it move an arm, then to carefully sort through little porcelain cats without
breaking them, *then* to lift a box and swing a bat. Once you have the precision
taken care of, the broader movements will be easier to work on. Aside from that,
most people use mobile nowadays, and the number will probably only increase.
3. I had some trouble with the navbar. Particularly, I had trouble getting the
dropdown contents to be in a list fashion. I eventually remembered I could just
make it a table. More generally, I struggled a lot with workload the past... how
many weeks now? I'm not even sure anymore. This semester was pretty rough, and
I should take notes from my experiences. I pretty much brute-forced as much as I
could to overcome the challenges of this semester.
