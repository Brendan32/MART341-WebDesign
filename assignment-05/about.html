    <p>Theodor Seuss Geisel, or Dr. Seuss, was an author of many famous
    children's books, like the story you just read, <i>the Cat In the Hat,</i>
    <i>The Lorax,</i> <i>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</i>, and many more.
    I'm not sure what else to include. His books have become movies many times.
    That one with Jim Carrey as the Grinch was personally not to my taste. I
    have yet to see the new Grinch movie.  I heard the song Tyler, the Creator
    made for it, I Am the Grinch, it's pretty good. His cover of You're a Mean
    One wasn't so good, but you can't really do a lot to change that one.</p>
