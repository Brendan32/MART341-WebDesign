1. I came across a text input on the GameStop site. Above it said, "Sign Up to
Receive Exclusive Promotions, Coupons, and the Latest Events." There was a
placeholder in the text input that says, "Enter Your E-mail." Evidently, the
placeholder serves to tell you what you should be entering into the text box.
There was also a button to the side of the text box labeled "Join" that serves
to submit the entered e-mail to their server. All of this serves to give them
your e-mail for a subscription.
2. The plain text input allows the user to enter text into a box, which is used
to gather information from the user. Radio buttons allow the user to select one
choice from a list of choices, which is used to gather more controlled information.
The upload button allows the user to select a file from their computer and
upload it to the URL you provide in the action attribute.
