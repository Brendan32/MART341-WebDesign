1. Universal affects all elements, element affects one type of element, class
affects any elements with a given class, id affects the one single element with
a given id.  Using one over another is most useful for specifying particular parts
of the webpage for styling. Universal is great for visual aspects that cover the
whole page, like setting a background color for the whole site. Element is great
for specifying all of one type of element. Class is extremely valuable due to its
ability to, say, only affect two of the three divs, or affect a div, a p, and
an h1 element in the same way at the same time. Id is good for affecting one
specific element, like if you have three divs but only want to affect one.
2. I chose black, white, and rgb(255, 204, 0).  I chose black to be the background,
because it is much easier on the eyes than white, and is both sophisticated and
ominous. Black is a foreboding color, representing death. Being a webpage about
mass death, it seemed apt. I chose rgb(255, 204, 0) to emphasize the attention
towards the Sun, sunset, and fire.  Being a yellow, it is commonly paired pretty
well with black, so it fits in pretty well. White was mostly just to make the
text stand out in the black, but it also helps to call attention to the text
by being a different color from everything else, and being a polar opposite to
the background.
3. I had one big challenge: for a good while, I couldn't figure out how to center
the images in the site. Eventually, I asked in the Discord server, and someone
sent a link to directions on how to do it. These directions were successful,
which was wonderful.  Outside of that, most everything else was pretty easy.
