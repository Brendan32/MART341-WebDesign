      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <p>
        I'm fucking tired of all the perks <br />
        I've tried nothing, everything works <br />
        For less I'm worth, I've served my bid <br />
        All fuck life wasn't what it is <br />
        All fuck life was just a bridge <br />
        I seen some free landed some tricks <br />
        Far I see high time man quit <br />
        Won't let you know when I get going <br />
        Phone ring too long <br />
        <br />
        Phone ring too long, I'm probably gone <br />
        Ring tone jingle my swan song <br />
        I'll show you how to leave well enough alone <br />
        I'm not this world this on cue world <br />
        I fall back, concoct new worlds <br />
        I fall out in throbbing swirls <br />
        I fall until I stop this world <br />
        I fall the fuck off this world <br />
        <br />
        I live down the street from you <br />
        Noticed me, I've never seen you <br />
        Wonder what the fuck I do <br />
        Listen up, you nosy bitch, listen close <br />
        My most recent purchase, old black rope <br />
        Gonna learn how to tie it, hang it in my chamber <br />
        Perfect reminder, occult I'm made of <br />
        Come try it out whenever you wanna <br />
        Last night, 3:30 in the morning, Death on my front porch <br />
        Can feel him itching to take me with him, hail death <br />
        Fuck you waiting for <br />
        Like a question no one mention <br />
        He turns around, hands me his weapon <br />
        He slurs, "Use at your own discretion, it's been a pleasure, Stefan" <br />
        Head on like dead, on like grey <br />
        Death in your way, not in my way, I got my way <br />
        I was in my way, crept out my way, kept out my way <br />
        I'm on one like bae, you're on your way, way, way, way <br />
        Head on like dead, on like grey <br />
        Death in your way, not in my way, I got my way <br />
        I was in my way, crept out my way, kept out my way <br />
        I'm on one like bae, you're on your way, way, way, way <br />
        <br />
        I'm fucking tired of all the perks <br />
        I've tried nothing, everything works <br />
        For less I'm worth, I've served my bid <br />
        All fuck life wasn't what it is <br />
        All fuck life was just a bridge <br />
        I seen some free landed some tricks <br />
        Far I see high time man quit <br />
        Won't let you know when I get going <br />
        Phone ring too long <br />
        <br />
        Don't you worry, impossible for anything to be a big deal <br />
        I'm in no weary, my vital post dated <br />
        But clearly been ages since life had appeal <br />
        Far more than fascination <br />
        My second nature chant kill cause I can <br />
        This body by my own hands <br />
        My friends and family won't understand <br />
        So I stay in the end, don't make none to me <br />
        If it wasn't for them, I'd make that decision <br />
        On GP <br />
        Had to do it all again, I'd make that decision <br />
        On GP <br />
        <br />
        All the nights I don't die for you <br />
        Wouldn't believe how many nights I ain't died for you <br />
        On GP <br />
        Not that I care, I'd be a liar <br />
        If I sat here claiming I'd exit in a minute <br />
        But I can't say I wouldn't, I have my limits <br />
        All the nights I don't die for you <br />
        Wouldn't believe how many nights I ain't died for you <br />
        On GP <br />
        Not that I care, I'd be a liar <br />
        If I sat here claiming I'd exit in a minute <br />
        But I can't say I wouldn't, I have my limit <br />
        All the nights I don't die <br />
        (I'm fucking tired)

      <p>This is a piano cover of the song. I came across it while looking for the regular song.
        I just thought I would share, I find it very interesting.</p>
