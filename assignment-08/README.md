1. Put short: divs group several elements as one block for styling, spans indicate
inline portions for styling, classes identify one or more elements for styling,
and ids are identifiers exclusive to each element.
2. It makes it a lot easier to host media, as you don't need to worry about file
sizes or getting all the file types, as the service will generally take care of
this for you. However, this also means you have to depend on another server
instead of just depending solely on your own, which can get problematic.
3. One challenge I had was sort of minor. I pasted the lyrics to the song, then
began typing line breaks at the end of each line. That was going to be very
tedious, until I realised I could just copy and paste it, making the job much
faster. Another challenge I had was with my sleep schedule. I'm still struggling
with it. It has been a significant hindrance on my time management. I am still
working on overcoming it.
