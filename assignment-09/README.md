1. Well, basically, I learned how to do HTML in general. All of it was new to me,
so all of it was learned in this class. I learned how to structure a basic webpage,
how to structure paragraphs, how to make tables, lists, embed videos, images, audio,
maps, how to include links, how to make textboxes, buttons, how to style all of it
with only HTML, and so on and so forth. None of it was particularly difficult for
me, interestingly. I guess I have a knack for it.
2. Honestly, I'm not sure. I'm excited that I'll be able to start making my
webpages more visually appealing. I'm excited to see what exactly I'll be able
to do. There's also a little test project I want to do over the next while. I'll
probably show it to you once I'm working on it. When we learned about how to
embed webpages into your own pages, I noticed you could access hyperlinks in the
embedded pages. It got me wondering how far you could go if you embedded a page
that has an embedded page, which contains an embedded page, and so on. I thought
about it more and thought it would be interesting to make a game of scrolling
and searching through embedded pages to go as deep down as you can. So I guess
I'm excited to test that idea while doing class stuff.
3. I feel I successfully organized the webpages to be pleasant and contain all
the necessary information. I struggled a bit with certain parts, mostly just with
remembering what to do for different elements and such. I hope that, when I push
the site and it goes live, there aren't too many issues existing.
