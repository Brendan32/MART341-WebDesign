      <p>Are you writing a story and want an easy-to-create language for your
      fictional people? Do you want a coded speech that you could easily
      translate and easily speak? Just want to dabble in conlanging for fun?
      Then this Instructable is just for you! I'll explain how to easily create
      a <dfn title="constructed language: a language you create!">conlang</dfn>
      using a <dfn title="a code where you swap letters for other letters">
      substitution cipher</dfn>, with no need to write a whole dictionary.</p>

    <h2>Step One: What Do You Want?</h2>
    <div id="step-one">
      <img src="./images/step-one-image.jpg" alt="a girl thinking to herself in front of a blue background"
      title="Girl thinking" />
      <p>First, and most importantly, you should start by thinking about what
      you want your result to be. Do you want something <i>fantasy-like</i>?
      Something <i>menacing</i>? Something <i>pleasant</i>? This will greatly
      influence your decisions as you go, especially in step 4. Something that
      often helps, though it isn't necessary, is taking a word you have in mind
      and changing the letters to what you'd like to see (ex. "heart" to "suyld").
      You can then take this and apply it to other words, and work from there.
      Below I provide a table to illustrate the changes that occur with each step.
      <strong>Bear in mind:</strong> you do not need to follow my example to the
      letter. This is simply to guide you. Make your creation your own!</p>
      <table class="examples">
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Samples</th>
          <th scope="col">Results</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>I walked to the park.</td>
          <td>I walked to the park.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>He ate one cookie.</td>
          <td>He ate one cookie.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>She stands straight.</td>
          <td>She stands straight.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>The dogs are barking.</td>
          <td>The dogs are barking.</td>
        </tr>

    <h2>Step Two: The Vowels</h2>
    <div id="step-two">
      <img src="./images/step-two-image.jpg" alt="the English vowels, a e i o u (and y)"
      title="The vowels!" />
      <p>The best method is to restrict yourself to substituting vowels for other
      vowels. If you substitute vowels for consonants, pronouncing your words
      can get hairy pretty quickly (just think what would happen if I
      substituted A for T: tpple, ctp, ptn, etc). But, wait a minute, why did I
      include the letter Y? Well, fun fact, the letter Y is much more often a
      vowel than a consonant. Plus, if we make Y a vowel, the places where it is a
      consonant won't be heavily affected.</p>

      <p>So, for my example, I'll just make it simple and reverse them. A is Y,
      E is U, I is O, and all vice versa. Here, you can choose yourself what is
      what, and you can easily experiment and change it later.</p>
      <table class="examples">
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Samples</th>
          <th scope="col">Results</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>I walked to the park.</td>
          <td>O wylkud ti thu pyrk.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>He ate one cookie.</td>
          <td>Hu ytu inu ciikou.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>She stands straight.</td>
          <td>Shu stynds stryoght.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>The dogs are barking.</td>
          <td>Thu digs yru byrkong.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Not much yet, but we've only just started!</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Step Three: The Consonants</h2>
    <div id="step-three">
      <img src="./images/step-three-image.jpg" alt="the English consonants in order"
      title="The consonants!" />
      <p>Since there are many more of them, the consonants will naturally
      influence your result far more than the vowels. You have very few
      restrictions here. You don't even have to do a strict 1-to-1 substitution.
      You could make three different consonants become one, or introduce
      completely new consonants to use. Generally, do what sounds right to you!
      Anything that comes out weird or unpronouncable can be revised later.</p>

      <p>So, for this I'll get a little more complicated. All the voiceless
      consonants with voiced counterparts will switch to the voiced counterparts,
      and vice versa. B is P, D is T, F is V, G is K, S is Z, and all vice versa.
      What about C, H, J, L, M, N, Q, R, W, and X? Let's say, C is G, H is S, J
      is T, L is R and vice versa, M is N and vice versa, Q is K, W is L, and X
      is F. That should give us something to work with, if not a good enough
      result to be used.</p>
      <table class="examples">
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Samples</th>
          <th scope="col">Results</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>I walked to the park.</td>
          <td>O lyrgut di dsu bylg.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>He ate one cookie.</td>
          <td>Su ydu imu giigou.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>She stands straight.</td>
          <td>Zsu zdymtz zdlyoksd.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>The dogs are barking.</td>
          <td>Dsu tikz ylu pylgomk.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Well, it's certainly unrecognizable from the original English. However,
      some of it might do with some tweaking, by the looks of it.</p>
      <a href="#">Back to top</a>
    </div>

    <h2>Step Four: Editing</h2>
    <div id="step-four">
      <p>Now that you have all the letters jumbled up into a new form, you may
      have a few problematic results. Personally, I'm not sure I'd enjoy trying
      to pronounce "zdlyoksd." So, here you can change what letters become what,
      but you can also start making rules. Rules are essentially addendums to the
      substitutions that can take plenty of different forms. Collapsing clusters
      of letters, changing the substitutions in certain conditions, moving letters
      in a word around, etc. These can help to simplify words and closer
      approximate what you want from the code.</p>

      <p>So, I'm going to make a rule that vowel clusters will collapse into
      whichever vowel is first in the word. I'll also make a rule that m must
      switch to n if preceding k, g, t, or d, and n must switch to m if
      preceding b or p. Finally, I'll make a rule that any consonant clusters
      larger than two letters in a root word must drop all but the first two
      consonants. This all might seem complicated, but it'll make things much
      simpler.</p>
      <table class="examples">
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Samples</th>
          <th scope="col">Results</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>I walked to the park.</td>
          <td>O lyrgut di dsu bylg.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>He ate one cookie.</td>
          <td>Su ydu imu gigo.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>She stands straight.</td>
          <td>Zsu zdyntz zdyks.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>The dogs are barking.</td>
          <td>Dsu tikz ylu pylgonk.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Now that I'm finished with it for the purposes of this guide, I will
      show a full paragraph as an example.</p>
        <blockquote>
          An elephant is the biggest living animal on land. It is quite huge in
          size. It is usually black or grey in colour. Elephants have four legs,
          a long trunk and two white tusks near their trunk. Apart from this,
          they have two big ears and a short tail. Elephants are vegetarian.
          They eat all kinds of plants especially bananas. They are quite social,
          intelligent and useful animals. They are used to carry logs of wood
          from one place to another. They are good swimmers.

      <p>Perhaps it could use some more work, but overall it serves its purpose
      pretty well! If yours isn't what you wanted, continue revising, creating
      rules, whatever you need to get it to what you want. It's yours to mold
      and shape, so do what you want with it!</p>
